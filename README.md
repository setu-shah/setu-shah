### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I recently graduated with a Master's degree in [Business Analytics](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/degree-programs/ms-business-analytics/) at the Questrom School of Business, Boston University. I also have a Bachelor's degree in [Political Economy](https://politicaleconomy.berkeley.edu/) from University of California, Berkeley.

My interdisciplinary education and diverse work experience have equipped me with strong skills in data analysis, problem-solving, and cross-functional collaboration. As a lifelong learner, I am passionate about tackling complex challenges and delivering meaningful, data-driven solutions to real-world problems.
